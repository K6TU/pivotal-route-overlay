# Pivotal-Route-Overlay (PRO)

PRO is a Chrome extension (compatible with Brave and other Chromium browsers) that overlays flight plan routes on Pivotal Weather (www.pivotalweather.com) weather maps.

## Key Features

- **Automatic FAA NASR Data Management**: Automatically fetches and updates the current FAA 28-day NASR datasets (Airports, Navaids, Waypoints). No manual update required.
- **Version & Data Status Display**: Shows extension version and FAA cycle date in the sidebar.
- **Map Area Detection**: Sidebar displays the current map region (CONUS, sub-regions, etc.) and clips/scales routes to match map boundaries.
- **Draggable & Persistent Sidebar**: Sidebar can be dragged and its position is remembered per tab session.
- **Route Input & Drawing**: Enter a route using airport IDs, VORs, or waypoint names. Click "Parse & Draw" to decode and draw the route over the map.
- **Airspeed Input & Hour-Marks**: Specify airspeed (knots) to show hour-mark triangles along the route.
- **Customizable Route Appearance**: Controls for route color and width.
- **Route Clipping & Scaling**: Route is clipped and scaled to the selected map area using robust algorithms.
- **Debug Logging**: Enable debug mode to show detailed status and logs in the sidebar.
- **Per-Tab Airspeed Persistence**: Airspeed value is remembered per tab.
- **Route Persistence**: Route and appearance are cached and automatically restored on page reloads (including animated loops).
- **Improved UI Layout**: Controls are aligned and sized for clarity and usability.

## How It Works

1. Load a weather map on Pivotal Weather.
2. The PRO sidebar appears at the top right.
3. Enter a route (e.g., `KHWD KDVT`), set airspeed, color, and width as desired.
4. Click "Parse & Draw" to visualize the route and hour-marks.
5. Sidebar shows current map area and FAA cycle date. Debug mode can be enabled for troubleshooting.
6. Route and settings persist across reloads and animated loops.
