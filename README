Pivotal-Route-Overlay (PRO)

PRO is an extension compatible with Chrome based broswers (including Brave) that will draw
a flight plan route on a Pivotal Weather (www.pivotalweather.com) weather map.

The extension is automatically loaded when a weather map is loaded from the site
and displays a control dialog at the top right of the loaded page.

The dialog has controls to:

Update NASR - forces a download of the Current FAA 28 Day NASR subscription data which
provides datasets for Airports, Navaids and Waypoints.

Parse & Draw - after the NASR data has been loaded, a route may be entered using airport
identifiers, VORs or Waypoint names.  Clicking Parse & Draw will decode the route, map
the identifiers to geo-coordinates and then draws a line over the map.

Controls are provided to select the color (Red by default) and width (3 px by default)
of the line drawn.


Both the route and NASR data are cached by the extension.

The extension will re-draw a previously entered route on each page reload action.  This 
enables the line to be drawn over animated image loops.

Enhancements planned:
- Automatic detection and load of updates to NASR data
- Detection and handling of other map constraints beyond just CONUS
